1) Make a new directory
2) setup an express server
3) make 'public/' your static asset directory

4) Make the page load CSS
5) Make the page load a client-side JS script

6) Write a 3x3 grid to #root using JS
- give it some space to look good
- it will later display a character (X or O)
- You can put in some random X and O just to see what it looks like
- DO NOT USE A TABLE
- DO NOT USE FLOAT

7) Have a data model that you can use to GENERATE the html.
8) ...generate the HTML from that data.

9) Write a REST service that gives you the board data
10) fetch that service and populate the board

11) Add a status area to the HTML
12) Update it when an error occurs

13) Make it so that clicking a square fills it with an 'X'
-- don't worry about the model yet, just update the square

14) Make it so that clicking a square updates the model 
-- so you need to store the model before drawing the board

15) Write a service that takes IN a board and checks for a winner
-- return if someone one, or if tie
-- return WHO won
-- this can be one or multiple fields, your choice

16) Announce who has won (or if it is a Tie)!
