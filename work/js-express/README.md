## Goal and Requirements

The Chat application will work for multiple users to have usernames, allow logout, and remove the default messages/users

* Will have a "Logout" button that sends (POST) the username (name=username) that will remove that user from the user list
* The default message/users should be removed
* `http://localhost:3000/` will check to see if the user is considered logged in
    * If they are, it will display the chat application
    * If they are not, it will redirect them to `/login` (GET) which will display a form asking for a username (name = 'username')
* The login form will 
   * POST (not GET) to `/login`
   * which will add the username to the user list, 
   * redirect them to `/`
* The base chat page
   * Will send their user name as a hidden field (name=username) to the server when posting a new message
   * Will have a "Refresh" button that loads the base chat page
* Messages from logged out users should still be visible
* It should be reasonably attractive
* The visuals should make it easy to use
* It should maintain/extend the separation of concerns used in the existing files
* It should follow the best practices outlined in class
* I should be able to run your code with `npm install` and then `node server.js`

## Allowances
* You may modify the HTML as you see fit
    * But it must be fundamentally semantically valid and other best practices from class
* You may modify the CSS as you see fit
    * But you must follow the best practices given in class
* The `name` form fields attributes must NOT change
    * username for the username
    * text for the new messageÂ text

* You must use the route paths as given/described
    * /
    * /chat
    * /login
    * /logout
* You may add additional JS files (server-side ONLY) that you write
    * But they must maintain/extend the existing separation of concerns
